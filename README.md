__### Optional Depencies and tools__

- ## Samba
Samba is used to connect your Raspberry pi to your local network so that way you don't have to issue ssh command or putty each time you want to access your file. It helps you share file between you Raspberry Pi and your PC and use any editor of your choice to develop your python app while running your code on your Pi.
